Getting SNMP tools
==================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

The SNMP tools are provided under terms and conditions of BSD-style
license, and can be freely downloaded from 
`PyPI <http://pypi.org/project/snmpclitools/>`_ or
GitHub (`master branch <https://github.com/etingof/snmpclitools/archive/master.zip>`_).

The best way to obtain SNMP tools and dependencies is to *pip install*
them all into a Python virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python3 -m venv venv3
   $ . venv3/bin/activate
   $ pip install snmpclitools

or

.. code-block:: bash

   $ easy_install snmpclitools

In case you do not have the *easy_install* command on your system but still
would like to use the on-line package installation method, please install 
`setuptools <http://pypi.org/project/setuptools>`_ package by 
downloading and running `ez_setup.pz <https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py>`_ bootstrap:

.. code-block:: bash

   # wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py
   # python ez_setup.py

In case you are installing SNMP tools on an off-line system, the following
packages need to be downloaded and installed:

* `PyASN1 <https://pypi.org/project/pyasn1>`_,
  used for handling ASN.1 objects
* `PySNMP <https://pypi.org/project/pysnmp/>`_,
  SNMP engine implementation

Optional, but recommended:

* `PyCryptodomex <https://pypi.org/project/pycryptodomex/>`_,
  used by SNMPv3 crypto features
* `PySMI <https://pypi.org/project/pysmi/>`_ for automatic
  MIB download and compilation. That helps visualizing more SNMP objects
* `Ply <https://pypi.org/project/ply/>`_, parser generator
  required by PySMI

The installation procedure for all the above packages is as follows 
(on UNIX-based systems):

.. code-block:: bash

   $ tar zxf package-X.X.X.tar.gz 
   $ cd package-X.X.X 
   # python setup.py install 
   # cd .. 
   # rm -rf package-X.X.X

we could try to help out.
